# React Admin Panel Project

This is a project I have started in August 22. I am utilising JSX because it is recommended when working with React and I am utilising SCSS for the styling. I am new to front-end development, but these appear the better options currently. For backend implementation, I intend to utilise Firebase. I have generally in the past, utilised MySQL or similar SQL database, however, Firebase looks very useful and should integrate beautifully with React.

## Completion 1/10

I have only just started this project, but I will continue to add to it and improve it. My experience is with statically type coding languages, predominantly C# (although I can manage to code in any language, I efficiently code in C# with minimal learnings/studying).

### `Use Cases`

I am creating this admin panel for my business, however with this, I aim to fill a gap within the NDIS software market. Currently, NDIS software is costly, despite realistic runnings costs being extremely low.

### `Requirements`

The requirements list realistically isn't large. It should have a client management aspect which stores basic client information, case notes for staff about the clients, incident reporting which aligns with NDIS reporting requirements, employee management seciton (not for payroll, just for basic employee information), and finally, important resources which could be training resources for staff or NDIS resources for participants.
