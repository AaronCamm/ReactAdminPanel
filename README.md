# React Admin Panel Project

This is a project I have started end of August. I am utilising JSX because it is recommended when working with React and I am utilising SCSS for the styling. I am new to front-end development, but these appear the better options currently. I am using Firebase as my BaaS. I have generally in the past, utilised MySQL or similar SQL database, however, Firebase looks very useful and should integrate well with React.

## Completion 4/10

I have only just started this project, but I will continue to add to it and improve it. Although my experience is with statically type coding languages (predominantly C#), I can generally manage to code in any language with a little learning.

### `Use Cases`

I am creating this admin panel for my business, however with this, I aim to fill a gap within the NDIS software market. Currently, NDIS software is costly, despite realistic runnings costs being extremely low. Once completed, I may have my code refined and then make the build available for others to use to avoid costly services.

### `Requirements`

The requirements list realistically isn't large. It should have a client management aspect which stores basic client information, case notes for staff about the clients, incident reporting which aligns with NDIS reporting requirements, employee management seciton (not for payroll, just for basic employee information), have efficient Firebase database inclusion and finally, important resources which could be training resources for staff or NDIS resources for participants.

### `List of Things To Do`

I will add to this list as I realise what I have forgotten, haha.
- Finish dashboard functionality (will likely involve a To-Do and Appointment widget connected to Firebase).
- Complete designs for 'Single' pages for each section.
- Need to change the view icon to a download icon and then make that functional.
- Invoice section hasn't been touched yet (will likely do a little bit of this before jumping back into the other things).
- Notifications and Profile both need functionality and their own page + designs.
- Most functions need their own 'New' functionality 'New Employee', 'New Participant', etc.
- Documents section needs the ability to upload documents - should be simple enough.
- Error handling
- Sanitization
