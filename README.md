# React Admin Panel Project

This is a project I have started end of August. I am utilising JSX because it is recommended when working with React and I am utilising SCSS for the styling. I am new to front-end development, but these appear the better options currently. I am using Firebase as my BaaS. I have generally in the past, utilised MySQL or similar SQL database, however, Firebase looks very useful and should integrate well with React.

I am continuously improving my knowledge around web-development and programming theory in general. 

## Completion 5/10

I have only just started this project, but I will continue to add to it and improve it. So far the development has been very smooth, styling and some functionalities take time to develop so I am taking my time and making improvements as I go.

Still quite a bit of functionality and styling to go.

### `Use Cases`

I am creating this admin panel for my business, however with this, I aim to fill a gap within the NDIS software market. Currently, NDIS software is costly, despite realistic runnings costs being extremely low. Once completed, I may have my code refined and then make the build available for others to use to avoid costly services.

### `Requirements`

The requirements list realistically isn't large. It should have a client management aspect which stores basic client information, case notes for staff about the clients, incident reporting which aligns with NDIS reporting requirements, employee management seciton (not for payroll, just for basic employee information to link to client records), have efficient Firebase database inclusion and finally, important resources which could be training resources for staff or NDIS resources for participants.
